# Find a coach

The application helps you find a coach to teach you skills in your area of interest. You can also register as a coach (if you're one) and receive enquiries from potential students. All data is persistent (saved in a database).

This app was built using [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/), [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/), [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).

The live project is deployed at [Firebase](https://fir-coaches.web.app/coaches).

It was a course project originally made with Vuex. I took on the extra challenge to rewrite it with the new Pinia central state menagement library as a practice after two years of not using VueJS.
